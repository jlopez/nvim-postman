# Neovim Postman
This repository contains REST requests for several web APIs.

They can be executed within Neovim using the
[rest-nvim/rest.nvim](https://github.com/rest-nvim/rest.nvim) plugin. Secrets
and other configuration parameters can be defined in a local `.env` file or by
setting environment variables.
